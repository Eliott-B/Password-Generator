# Password-Generator
Password Generator (12 characters, at least 1 lower case, 1 upper case and 1 special character) 

This program generates a complex password and adds it to a .txt file to have a directory.
You can find this script online if you need it :

If you just want the generator without the file, replace lines 49 to 52 with : 
`print(Create_Password())`
